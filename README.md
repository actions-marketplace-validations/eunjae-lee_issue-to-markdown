# issue-to-markdown

> GitHub Action to monitor and convert issues into markdown files within your repository.

How do you edit and manage your markdown files within your repository?

- `git pull`
- (merge conflicts)
- edit files
- `git commit`
- `git push`
- 😫

What if you could automatically convert GitHub Issues into markdown files, allowing you to write using just a browser?

## Usage

Create a file `.github/workflows/issue-to-markdown.yml` (or any filename) in your repository.

```yml
on:
  issues:
    types:
      - labeled

jobs:
  issue_to_markdown:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
      - uses: eunjae-lee/issue-to-markdown@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
      - uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4
        with:
          commit_message: 'docs: update contents'
```

If you add a `publish` label to any of your issues, this workflow will be activated.

To automatically update the markdown file after making changes to the issue, update the yml file as follows:

```yml
on:
  issues:
    types:
      - labeled
      - edited
```

## How It Works

<details>
<summary>
For those unfamiliar with GitHub Actions, here's a breakdown of the process:
</summary>

1. In this step, the repository is cloned. A personal access token must be provided as token to allow the workflow to commit and push changes to the remote.

```yml
- uses: actions/checkout@v3
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```

2. In this step, the issue is transformed into a markdown file, located in its own folder (default location: `content/<slug or issue_number>/index.md`). The token is also necessary here.

```yml
- uses: eunjae-lee/issue-to-markdown@v1
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```

3. In this step, changes are committed and pushed to the remote. For more information on customizing the commit, refer to [this](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action).

```yml
- uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4
  with:
    commit_message: 'docs: update contents'
```

</details>

## Personal Access Token

Visit https://github.com/settings/tokens/new to create a new personal access token. Choose "Tokens (classic)" instead of "Fine-grained tokens".

## Options

```yml
- uses: eunjae-lee/issue-to-markdown@v1
  with:
    # Required
    token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}

    # ----------------------------------
    # All parameters below are optional.
    # ----------------------------------

    # New files are located at `<project-root>/<dest>/<slug or issue_number>/index.md`. (default: 'content')
    dest: 'content'

    # (default: '.md')
    extension: '.md'

    # If set to `true`, the `slug` from the frontmatter of the issue body will be used as the folder name instead of `issue_number`. If set to `false`, only `issue_number` is used. (default: true)
    slug_as_folder_name: true

    # Key for the slug from the frontmatter. This is used only when `slug_as_folder_name` is `true`. (`slug` by default.)
    slug_key: 'slug'

    # By default, `publish` label is required for the workflow to work.
    label: 'publish'

    # If not given, only the owner of the repository is authorized to perform this Action. Otherwise, it will fail.
    authors:
      - username1
      - username2

    # Let user provide a custom path for output file instead of relying on conventions (default: false)
    use_custom_path: false

    # Key for the custom path (when use_custom_path is true, default: 'full_path')
    use_custom_path_key: 'full_path'

    # If set to `true`, the title of the issue is injected into the frontmatter of the generated file. (default: true)
    inject_title: true

    # Key to be injected for the title. (default: 'title')
    inject_title_key: 'title'

    # Inject created timestamp of issue into the frontmatter of the generated file. (default: false)
    inject_created_at: false

    # Key to be injected for the timestamp. (default: 'created_at')
    inject_created_at_key: 'created_at'

    # Formatter for created timestamp based on Day.js (default: 'ISO')
    # For more information about formatting, read this: https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs/
    inject_created_at_format: 'ISO'

    # Whether or not to wrap the value with double quotes. (default: false)
    inject_created_at_as_string: false

    # Inject updated timestamp of issue into the frontmatter of the generated file. (default: false)
    inject_updated_at: false

    # Key to be injected for the timestamp.(default: 'updated_at')
    inject_updated_at_key: 'updated_at'

    # Formatter for updated timestamp based on Day.js (default: 'ISO')
    # For more information about formatting, read this: https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs/
    inject_updated_at_format: 'ISO'

    # Whether or not to wrap the value with double quotes. (default: false)
    inject_updated_at_as_string: false
